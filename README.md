## Overview

This Application is an Asp.Net Core Api built using Clean Architecture. The primary purpose for this application is to track Attendance Occurences for Students/Instructors in Scheduled Courses. To support this functionality, the application also allows a user to create records for Students/Instructors, Subjects/Courses, and of course the data needed to track Attendance in any Courses Scheduled to be taught by an instructor to attended by a Student.

### How Is This Application Structured

This Application is structured following the Clean Architecture (or sometimes referred to as Ports and Adapters) Pattern. The Api also utilizes the Mediator pattern to separate the api from any of the logic on how requests are handled. This means that for each endpoint there is a Request object, which is tied to a Handler object. Each Handler defines how that request is handled. Below is a breakdown of the projects (excluding test projects) in this application and how they fit into the structure.

- AttendanceTracker.Domain
  - Class Library (.Net 6) 
  - Models, Enums, ExtensionMethods, Exceptions, Validation, etc. are stored in this project.
  - This is the core of the application. This project does not depend on any other projects.
- AttendanceTracker.Database
  - Sql Server Database Project (2019)
  - This holds the Database Schema that this Application depends on.
  - You can publish this Database Project to your own Database to create the necessary tables to run this Application.
  - Post Deployment Scripts will seed tables with data.
- AttendanceTracker.Data
  - Class Library (.Net 6)
  - This Class Library (or Port) encapsulates the Read/Write Access to the Database.
  - Calls to Dapper ORM Dependency are abstracted through [DataAccess.cs](https://github.com/uhyeay2/AttendanceTracker/blob/main/AttendanceTracker.Data/Implementation/DataAccess.cs) class.
    - This Abstracts All SQL Transactions To ExecuteAsync(), FetchAsync(), & FetchListAsync() Methods.
  - DataRequestObjects and DataTransferObjects are stored in this project.
  - SqlGeneration is used to quickly create basic queries/commands.
    - SqlGeneration Methods Are Unit Tested.
  - The AttendanceTracker.Data project depends on AttendanceTracker.Domain
- AttendanceTracker.Application
  - Class Library (.Net 6)
  - This Class Library (or Port) encapsulates the logic on how Requests are Handled.
    - This is where the Mediator Pattern is implemented.
  - This is where Requests/Handlers are stored that the Api would send requests for.
    - RequestObjects are public and stored in the same file as Handlers.
    - Handlers are internal so the impelmentation is encapsulated, and only the requests are exposed.
    - Handlers define the logic on how a request is handled.
  - The AttendanceTracker.Application project depends on AttendanceTracker.Domain and AttendanceTracker.Data
- AttendanceTracker.Api
  - Asp.Net Core Api (.Net 6)
  - This Api exposes functionality for the Applications different features.
  - Implements Global ExceptionHandling Middleware
  - Logs Request Response Time via Middleware
  - The AttendanceTracker.Api project depends on AttendanceTracker.Domain and AttendanceTracker.Application

## Projects

With this application following Clean Architecture (or sometimes referred to as Ports And Adapters), each project would represent a different Port for this Application. The Domain is the core of the Application, so it has no dependencies on any other projects. Each of the other Projects/Ports would encapsulate functionality to a different section of the Application. For example, all interactions with the Database are encapsulated in the AttendanceTracker.Data project. In the below sections we will discuss each projects responsibility and any notes to highlight from that project.

#### [Return To Table Of Contents](https://github.com/uhyeay2/AttendanceTracker/blob/main/README.md#table-of-contents)

### AttendanceTracker.Domain

The Domain, as mentioned previously, is the core of the application. This project does not depend on any other projects, and most other projects actually depend on this one. Below is some more information regarding what can be found in the Domain project.

- Constants
  - Constant Values related to Subjects, Courses, Students, and Instructors.
- Enums
  - At this time the only Enum is AttendanceOccurenceTypes, such as Absent, LateArrival, or EarlyLeave.
- Exceptions
  - Custom Exception classes created for AlreadyExists, DoesNotExist, ExpectationFailed, and ValidationFailed scenarios.
- Extensions
  - Extension Methods are stored in this namespace to expose common functionality to any dependencies that may need it.
- Factories
  - RandomCharacterFactory
  - RandomStringFactory
- Interfaces
  - This namespace would house interface or contracts essential across the application.
  - At this time, IValidatable and IRandomCharacterFactory are the only Interfaces stored in this project.
- Models
  - These Models would be the Domain Object (Not Database Copy) of objects required for this application.
    - For Example, the Course_DTO would expose the Id, but the Course (Domain Object) would not.
    - Domain Objects may have other Domain (Complex) Objects as properties, whereas DTO's in the Data Layer would have primitive values.
- Policy
  - This namespace defines business Logic/Rules
  - Validation is defined in this area of the Application.
    - Validate{DataType} Classes have Extension Methods related to Validating Parameters of the specified Type.
    - Validation.cs provides helpers for Initializing/Checking List of ValidationFailureMessages (strings)
    - ValidationFailureMessage.cs provides helpers for generating messages regarding reason for Validation Failures.

### AttendanceTracker.Database

The Sql Server Database Project is really cool because it not only allows you to track source control for changes made to a database, but it also allows you to publish changes for your Database. So for example, whenever I create a new Table in my Database, I will actually first create the table in my Database project in Visual Studios, and then I will publish that Database Change to Sql Server through Visual Studios. Below is more information on this project:

- dbo (This is the source control for the Database Schema)
  - Tables
    - Create Table Statements are stored here.
    - When you publish the Database through Visual Studios it will use these .sql files.
- PostDeploymentScripts
  - Scripts/Post-Deployment
    - SeedTableScripts
      - This is where the individual scripts for seeding data into each table reside.
      - Each Seed Table Script uses a Merge statement that will Insert new records if they don't exist, or Update them to match the data in the Post Deployment Script if it has been changed (Matches by Id)
    - Script.PostDeployment.Sql
      - This is the PostDeploymentScript. It references each of the individual SeedTableScripts to run them one at a time in the specified order.

### AttendanceTracker.Data

The Data Project encapsulates the Sql Transactions sent to the Database. This is where the Application has a dependency on Dapper (ORM) for sending requests to the Database. DataRequests (Queries/Commands to send to the Database) are defined as IDataRequests. Meanwhile, data fetched from the Database are defined as DataTransferObjects. This Class Library is where the  [DataAccess.cs](https://github.com/uhyeay2/AttendanceTracker/blob/main/AttendanceTracker.Data/Implementation/DataAccess.cs) class is implemented. This class will handle any IDataRequest.

- Abstraction
  - BaseRequests
    - This is where Abstract classes are stored for common Request Objects, such as Guid_DataRequest or Id_DataRequest.
  - Interfaces
    - IDataAccess
      - This is the Interface abstracting the calls to Dapper.
      - ExecuteAsync() - This method will take in an IDataRequest and return an int representing the number of rows affected by the command.
      - FetchAsync() - This method will take in an IDataRequest < TResponse > and will return a QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync() for the TResponse defined in the IDataRequest.
      - FetchListAsync() - This method will take in an IDataRequest < TResponse> and will QueryAsync() an IEnumerable < TResponse > for the TResponse defined in the IDataRequest.
    - IDataRequest
      - This interface defines that any IDataRequest class must be able to GetSql() and GetParameters() to execute a Sql Query/Command.
      - There is an IDataRequest \<TResponse> which allows an IDataRequest Object to define what type of DTO it would Fetch/FetchList of.      
    - IDbConnectionFactory
      - This interface allows us to abstract out the implementation for how a new SqlConnection is created for each Sql Query/Command.
  - DataRequestObjects
    - This is where classes that implement the IDataRequest interface reside.
    - Requests are split into seperate features, IE: StudentRequest, InstructorRequests, CourseRequests.
    - Every IDataRequest will define methods to GetSql() and GetParameters()
  - DataTransferObjects
    - This is where classes that represent the data fetched from the database reside.
    - All IDataRequest \<TResponse> objects will define a TResponse from the DataTransferObjects namespace.
      - These DataTransferObjects (DTO's) are an exact match to the query that fetches them.
  - Implementation
    - DataAccess
      - This is the only reference to Dapper in the entire project. Every Sql Transaction goes through this class.
      - Breaks down all Sql Transactions into: ExecuteAsync(), FetchAsync(), FetchListAsync().
      - Depends on IDbConnectionFactory to instantiate IDbConnections to the Database at runtime.
     - DbConnectionFactory
       - This class is responsible for creating a new SqlConnection() at runtime.
       - Depends on Database ConnectionString that is stored as a private member to use at runtime.
     - DependencyInjection
       - This Extension Class injects dependencies to an IServiceCollection using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstraction
       - IDbConnectionFactory Added as Singleton using DbConnectionFactory
       - IDataAccess added as Scoped using DataAccess
  - SqlGeneration
    - Delete - Sql Generation For deleting from a table with a where condition.
    - Insert - Sql Generation For Insert Commands
      - IntoTable() - Pass in the TableName and (ColumnName, ValueName)[] Array to generate an Insert Statement.
        - Overload for only passing in only ColumnNames when ParameterNames match ColumnNames.
      - SelectIntoTable() - SqlGeneration Similar to IntoTable() but allows you to select values from another table for insert transaction.
    - Select - Sql Generation for Select Queries      
      - FromTable() - Define Table to select from, optionally define columns, and optionally define where statement. Defaults to use WITH(NOLOCK)
      - JoinFromTable() - Works similar to FromTable() but allows you to define joins.
      - PaginatedFromTable() - Works similar to FromTable() but allows you to define how many records to take, and offset (by pageNumber-1 * recordsPerPage)
      - Exists() - Define Table and where statement, optionally define columns and defaults to use WITH(NOLOCK)
    - Update - Sql Generation For Update Commands
      - CoalesceTable() - Define Table and Where statement with (ColumnName, ValueName)[] Array of items to Coalesce.
        - Overload for passing in only ColumnNames when ParameterNames match ColumnNames
    - TableNames (Constants)
      - This is a static class to hold constants representing the different Table names.

### AttendanceTracker.Application

The Application Project encapsulates the logic on how requests are handled. This is where I implemented the Mediator Pattern. For those that are familiar with MediatR (Nuget Package), you may notice some similarities with the IRequest, IHandler, and IOrchestrator interfaces. The IOrchestrator will receive an IRequest, and use an IHandlerFactory to instantiate the appropriate Handler at runtime. There is also RequestValidation that is automatically processed for any IRequest object that also implements the AttendenaceTracker.Domain.IValidatabale interface.

- Abstraction
  - BaseHandlers
    - This is where abstract classes are stored for consistently used dependencies, such as the DataHandler which depends on IDataAccess to interact with the Database.
  - BaseRequests
    - This is another place where abstract classes reside. An example would be RequiredGuidRequest which is an IRequest that has a 'Guid' Property expected in the body.
      - These 'Required' BaseRequests help to reduce repeated code on Request Validation Rules.
  - Interfaces
    - IHandler
      - IHandler\<TRequest> and IHandler\<TRequest, TResponse> interfaces define contracts for handling synchronous requests.
      - ITaskHandler\<TRequest> and ITaskHandler\<TRequest, TResponse> interfaces are for asynchronous requests.
    - IHandlerFactory
      - This interface defines the method called for instantiating a Handler at runtime.
    - IOrchestrator
      - This is the interface that projects which depend on the AttendanceTracker.Application will use.
      - Asynchronous requests will either call GetResponseAsync() or ExecuteRequestAsync()
      - Synchronous requests will use GetResponse() or ExecuteRequest()
      - Classes depending on this interface will define the TRequest and TResponse when making a call, but the Handler will be hidden from the caller.
    - IRequest
      - Each Handler will be tied to a class that implements the IRequest interface.
      - Handlers that return an object will implement the IRequest\<TResponse> interface.
 - Implementation
   - DependencyInjection
     - This Extension Class injects dependencies to an IServiceCollection using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstraction
     - Will use Reflection once to get a List\<Type> of all IHandlers to add to the ServiceCollection as a Singleton.
     - IHandlerFactory added as Singleton using HandlerFactory
     - IOrhcestrator added as Singleton using Orchestrator
     - IRandomCharacterFactory added as Singleton from RandomCharacterFactory
   - HandlerFactory
     - Helper Method GetHandler\<TRequest, THandler>() returns the first Type that implements the IHandler\<TRequest> or IHandler\<TRequest, TResponse> passed in.
       - Also works for the ITaskHandler\<TRequest> and ITaskHandler\<TRequest, TResponse>
     - Helper method for Instantiate\<TRequest, THandler> which will create an instance of the THandler requested using the IServiceProvider built from the applications IServiceCollection.
     - This class depends on the List\<Type> that's generated using Reflection at Startup, and the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ActivatorUtiltiies to instantiate (handler) objects at runtime.
   - Orchestrator
     - This class implements the IOrchestrator interface that IRequest's would be sent to (Similar to the IMediator interface from MedaitR)
     - Request Validation happens here before a Handler is instantiated for a request.
     - This class depends on the IHandlerFactory to instantiate a handler when a request is received.
 - RequestHandlers
   - This is where classes that implement the IHandler interfaces reside.
   - Handlers are broken down into features (such as Subject, Course, Student).
   - Each Handler.cs file will also contain the Request class that is tied to that handler.
     - The Request objects are public, but the Handlers are always internal.
       - The (Types of) Handlers are added to the IServiceCollection through the DependencyInjection, so they do not need to be exposed outside the assembly.

## Features

The primary functionality for this application is to allow a user to track Students/Instructors attendance occurences in ScheduledCourses. However, there are several other features that this application exposes functionality for. This section will go into more detail on each feature added to the application.

#### [Return To Table Of Contents](https://github.com/uhyeay2/AttendanceTracker/blob/main/README.md#table-of-contents)

### Subject

A Subject groups common courses. When creating a Subject a unique SubjectCode must be provided, as well as the Subject's Name. Once the Subject is created, then Courses can be created using the SubjectCode. Other than creating Subjects, you can also Fetch them from the database and delete them using the SubjectCode.

#### [Return To Table Of Contents](https://github.com/uhyeay2/AttendanceTracker/blob/main/README.md#table-of-contents)

### Course

A Course can be defined as a Class that pertains to a Subject. For example, the 'Math' subject, could have multiple Courses such as 'Algebra 1', 'Geometry 1', etc. When a course is created, a SubjectCode is provided (along with a Name). A unique CourseCode is generated using the SubjectCode and a short series of random numbers. Once the Course is created, then an Instructor can create a CourseScheduled that they would teach. Other than creating Courses, you can also Fetch, Update, and Delete them using the CourseCode as an identifier.

#### [Return To Table Of Contents](https://github.com/uhyeay2/AttendanceTracker/blob/main/README.md#table-of-contents)

### Student

A Student is someone who would attend a CoursesScheduled to be taught by an Instructor. When a Student is created in the application, a random unique StudentCode will be generated that is a fixed size of random letters then numbers. Students can be created, fetched, updated, and deleted. Most requests use the StudentCode, but you can also search for students using their First and/or Last names.

#### [Return To Table Of Contents](https://github.com/uhyeay2/AttendanceTracker/blob/main/README.md#table-of-contents)

### Instructor

An Instructor would be an individual who teaches a course. When an Instructor is inserted a random unique InstructorCode is generated using their last name and a fixed length of random numbers. After the instructor has been created you can use their InstructorCode to insert a CourseScheduled that they would teach. Instructors can also be fetched, updated, and deleted.

### CourseScheduled

A CourseScheduled can be defined as a Course that an Instructor will teach within a specified date range. When a CourseScheduled is inserted, a CourseCode and InstructorCode are provided to identify who will be teaching what course, as well as the StartTime/EndTime. You can also fetch and delete CourseScheduled records. Once a CourseScheduled has been created, Students can begin to sign up for them.

### StudentCourseScheduled

A StudentCourseScheduled is a reference to a Specific Student that has signed up to attend a CourseScheduled to be taught by an instructor. The same student cannot sign up for the same CourseScheduled. However, they could retake the same Course at another time using a different CourseScheduled Guid. Once a StudentCourseScheduled has been created, then a StudentAttendanceOccurence can be created on any days that the Student misses class time.

### StudentAttendanceOccurence

A StudentAttendanceOccurence is created whenever a Student misses any time for a CourseScheduled that they have signed up to attend. This would record the Student, the CourseScheduled that they are missing time for, what day is impacted, whether or not the occurence is excused, and Notes related to the occurence.

## Testing

Testing is an important aspect of every application. This application ensures stability using both Integration and Unit tests with the popular framework xUnit. Each test project is responsible for testing a separate Port (Class Library) for the application. In this section we will review the test coverage for this project.

### AttendanceTracker.Data.Tests

The Data Tests are integrated with the Sql Server Database. This can often times be challenging, however this Test Project makes use of a DataSeeder that will not only insert new records and fetch them to be used in a test, but will also set queue the record to be deleted after the test runs. This helped a lot with reducing repeated code related to setting up a record to test with.

This xUnit Test project is broken up into the following:

- DataRequestTests
  - This is where tests can be found for Data Transactions (ExecuteAsync(), FetchAsync(), FetchListAsync() from IDataAccess).
  - RequestTests are split up into a separate namespace for each Feature, and one test Class per DataTransaction.
  - Each test here will inherit from the base class DataTest.cs that can be found in the TestHelpers namespace.
- SqlGenerationTests
  - This is where the tests for SqlGeneration reside.
  - There is one test class per SqlGeneration Class.
- TestHelpers
  - DataSeeder
    - This class has a helper which takes in three IDataRequests (Insert, Fetch, and Delete). This is used to Seed any records necessary, fetch them to be used in the test, and queue for deletion.
    - There is a method for PurgingSeededRecords which will delete all of the IDataRequests that have been queued for deletion.
    - A method exists for each table that can be inserted.
  - DataTest
    - Each DataRequest Test will implement this abstract base class.
    - This class provides the IDataAccess that will be needed to process each IDataRequest that is being tested.
    - The DataSeeder is kept as a property of this abstract class so that it is available in all Data tests.

### AttendanceTracker.Application.Tests

The Application tests are set up as unit tests. True Unit Testing will Mock Dependencies to ensure that a 'System Under Test' (SUT) is not testing any of its dependencies functionality, but instead only testing its own logic. The tests for the Application layer are set up to Mock dependencies using the popular Moq framework. So basically, since the Application.Data.Tests project is already testing DataTransactions, we don't really call them in these tests. Instead we Mock those calls to set up specific scenarios so we can test that the Handlers act the way they're supposed to in different events.

This xUnit Test Project is broken up into the following:

- HandlerTests
  - This is where the IHandler for each type of IRequest that the Api handles will be tested.
  - Handler tests are split up into a separate namespace for each Feature, and one test class per Handler.
  - Each HandlerTest will inherit from a base abstract class HandlerTest, which is used to reduce repeated code.
- TestHelpers
  - HandlerTest
    - Each Handler Test will implement this abstract base class.
    - This class provides Mock objects for the different dependencies used in the HandlerTests
      - Such as Mock\<IDataAccess> and Mock\<IOrchestrator>
    - This class also provided helper methods for doing Setup on Mocked objects.
      - For example, instead of having to type _mockedObject.Setup(_ => _.ExecuteAsync(inputToReceive)).Returns(Task.FromResult(outputToReturn)), you would just call SetupExecute(input, output);

### AttendanceTracker.Api.Tests

The Api is the outermost layer of the application. This is what is exposing functionality to the user. With the pattern that this project uses, the Controller methods really don't have any logic of their own. They call the IOrchestrator for their requests to be handled, and that has been unit tested in the Application.Tests project, meanwhile the Data transactions were integration tested with the database already. So I decided for the Api.Tests project to implement integration testing that ensures everything connects from end to end without any issues.

This xUnit Test Project is broken up into the following:

-IntegrationTests
  - This is where ControllerTests reside. Each of these are set up to run as integration tests using their dependencies concrete implementations, not Mocked objects.
  - Each test method inside a ControllerTest class will test a scenario, often times calling multiple controller methods.
-TestHelpers
  - ControllerTest
    - This base abstract class helps reduce repeated code for initializing the IOrchestrator dependency that all controllers share.
